# effect-template
This is a template for making effect applications, with documentation meant for llm ingest/instructions

## Project Structure
There are several levels of rules:
1. Core Rules
2. One Line Examples
3. Detailed Examples

The project is then in a file structure:

```
docs/
├── core-rules/
│   ├── core.md
│   ├── level-1/
│   └── level-2/
├── framework/
│   └── effect/
│       ├── <topic>/
│       │   ├── level-1/
│       │   └── level-2/
│       └── checklists/
│           └── <split into 20 item chunks>
└── project-details/
    └── rule-examples.md
```

For detailed examples of each rule level, see [docs/project-details/rule-examples.md](docs/project-details/rule-examples.md).
